I am an applied mathematics & computer science enthusiast.
I have worked on the deployment at scale of deep learning models for computer vision and NLP. 
Moreover, I work on a side research project: measure the uncertainty in ML models.

I am convinced that data scientists must have skills in both clean code practices and OPS to 
lead projects to production.
