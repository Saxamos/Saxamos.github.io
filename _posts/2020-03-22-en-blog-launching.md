I have finally found the time to launch my personal website 👨‍💻. I now start to feel like I've done something 
during the lockdown (playing the [Bach cello suite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGQLXRTl3Z0) with a tenor 
saxophone 🎷 and losing at️ FIFA 20 ⚽ does not count).

## To come up on this blog

After the deployment of this first article I'd like to:

1. Create an online résumé linked to this blog

2. Translate articles from my time at [OCTO Technology](https://www.octo.com/):

      - [Prediction Intervals](https://blog.octo.com/les-intervalles-de-prediction/)

      - [Probability Calibration](https://blog.octo.com/calibration-de-probabilite/)

      - [Train](https://blog.octo.com/ia-embarquee-deployer-du-deep-learning-sur-un-raspberry/), 
      [deploy](https://blog.octo.com/lia-embarquee-entrainer-deployer-et-utiliser-du-deep-learning-sur-un-raspberry-partie-2/) 
      [and serve Deep Learning on a Raspberry](https://blog.octo.com/lia-embarquee-entrainer-deployer-et-utiliser-du-deep-learning-sur-un-raspberry-partie-3/)
      , a triptych written with Constant Bridon and Paul De Nonancourt

3. Write new articles:

      - Deploy and serve ML model with streamlit

      - Adversarial learning to trick CNN

      - Maxentropy for image segmentation

      - Find weights for imbalanced dataset in production

      - Homography transformation for template matching


I am lucky to spend my confined time in the french Alpes, a quiet and beautiful place. Below is a picture taken 
by my roomate Elie Hamelin of the "Chapelle Notre-Dame du Charmaix", not far from our apartment.

> Built in the 15th century, on the rock in a narrow gorge. This sanctuary shelters a black virgin, visible and 
>lit from the outside. It is the most visited pilgrimage site in Maurienne.
