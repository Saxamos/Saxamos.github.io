I have finally found the time to launch my personal website 👨‍💻. I now start to feel like I've done something during the confinement (playing the [Bach cello suite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGQLXRTl3Z0) with a tenor saxophone 🎷 and losing at️ FIFA 20 ⚽ does not count 🤡).

## To come up on this blog

After the deployment of this first article I'd like to: 

1. Create an online résumé linked to this blog
2. Translate articles from my time at [OCTO Technology](https://www.octo.com/):
    - [Prediction Intervals](https://blog.octo.com/les-intervalles-de-prediction/)
    - [Probability Calibration](https://blog.octo.com/calibration-de-probabilite/)
    - [Train](https://blog.octo.com/ia-embarquee-deployer-du-deep-learning-sur-un-raspberry/), [deploy](https://blog.octo.com/lia-embarquee-entrainer-deployer-et-utiliser-du-deep-learning-sur-un-raspberry-partie-2/) [and serve Deep Learning on a Raspberry](https://blog.octo.com/lia-embarquee-entrainer-deployer-et-utiliser-du-deep-learning-sur-un-raspberry-partie-3/), a triptych written with Constant Bridon and Paul De Nonancourt
3. Write new articles:
    - Deploy an serve ML model with streamlit
    - Adversarial learning to trick CNN
    - Maxentropy for image segmentation
    - Find weights for imbalanced dataset
    - Homography transformation for template matching

I am lucky to spend my confined time in the french Alpes, a quiet and beautiful place. Below is a picture taken by my roomate Elie Hamelin of the "Chapelle Notre-Dame du Charmaix", not far from our apartment.

> Built in the 15th century, on the rock in a narrow gorge. This sanctuary shelters a black virgin, visible and lit from the outside. It is the most visited pilgrimage site in Maurienne.
